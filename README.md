# ðŸ“± SMS Spam Detection with Hyperparameter Tuning

A machine learning classifier to detect spam messages in SMS data using NLP techniques and model tuning.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project uses text preprocessing and classification algorithms to distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones in a dataset of SMS messages.

### Key Goals:
- Preprocess SMS messages using NLP techniques
- Build a classification model (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Improve performance using hyperparameter tuning

## ðŸ§  ML & NLP Techniques

- TF-IDF Vectorization
- CountVectorizer
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- GridSearchCV for tuning

## ðŸ¤– Models Used

- Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Logistic Regression  

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Accuracy: > 96% (after tuning)
- Precision/Recall scores highlight robustness in spam detection

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

In a world full of unwanted messages, this project shows how ML can help fight spam effectively using Natural Language Processing and smart classification.
